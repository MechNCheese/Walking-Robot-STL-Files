# Walking-Robot-STL-Files
Here is a collection of 3D files for both versions 1 and 2 of my walking robot.
If anyone would like to print these out, please feel free to do so. I would recommed using Ultimaker Cura as a slicer.

Everthing I printed was modified slighty in Cura. In the upper right hand corner you will see something
that says "Standard Quality". Click on that and then you may have to click on advanced.
Type "hor" into the search bar and you should see "Horizontal Expansion".
Set that to 0.15mm and then set "Hole Horizontal Expansion" to 0.25mm

Of course most printers are different and this is what works for me.
